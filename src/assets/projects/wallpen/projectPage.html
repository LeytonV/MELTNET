        WallPen is a tool I created to help with creating interior levels for unity. Modelling walls, and corners, and all kinds
        of joins just to have to painstakingly pixel-perfect align them was tedious. I did reuse some of HEADACHE's code for this, which sped things up a lot
        as HEADACHE actually has this built into the level generator at runtime, which is fun.

        The addon is a floating editor window, that is created through <code>ScriptableObject.Create</code> rather than <code>EditorWindow.GetWindow</code>. 
            This effectively does the same thing, but where GetWindow creates a actual floating window, ScriptableObject.Create doesn't. But it does create an 
            <i>INSTANCE</i> of the window, allowing me to run stuff like OnSceneGUI, which creates buttons in the top left of the viewport.

        As for how the actual tool works, we project the mouse point onto a invisible plane at (0,0,0), giving us the world-space point the mouse is it.
            I then round it, and draw a square there just to indicate the cell the player is drawing on. The addon uses a 2D array to store cells, allowing you to 
            "draw" walls out. Once a cell has been updated, it scans around itself, and changes the models of its surrounding cells (and itself) accordingly.

        The addon also includes a "goodies" folder, that includes things like a triplanar shader so textures don't repeat over each wall, pre-built wall models to 
        help the user get started and more. The triplanar shader uses the world-space vertex position rather than the UV to sample the texture, meaning the texture always 
        stays unstretched no matter the size of the wall.
