        As an experiment, I wanted to try my hand at creating a procedural floating island generator. This was mainly for art, and taking
        pretty screenshots of, but also just an experiment for fun.

    <p class = "overviewText">To start with, the generator spawns a big "main" island with slightly variable size. This gets rotated randomly, and is placed randomly
        in a radius of the center of the map. I then choose between 2-3 smaller "sub-island" positions, and repeat the process for those, but with a much bigger radius.

    </div>

    <p class = "overviewText">Each island is then decorated using prefabs. What i used were rocks, mountains, hill and tree prefabs. I modeled these in a way that
        even if they are placed on the edge, they still look natural. I also added some floating rune-type things, as i thought it'd look really nice with the colors.
